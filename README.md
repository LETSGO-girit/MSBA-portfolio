## Data Science Methodology
### 1. Descriptive Questions: "What is the current status of our sales?"
#### Techniques : 
##### - Data aggregation : Combining data from the various sources into a unified view
##### - Data Mining : Extracting useful information from large datasets
##### - Data Visualization : Using visual tools to present data in an easily understanable format

### 2. Diagnostic Questions : "Why did our sales decline in the last quarter?"
#### Techniques : 
##### - Drill-down : Exporing detailed data to find underlying causes
##### - Data Discovery : Indentifying patterns and relationships in data
##### - Correlation Analysis : Assessing the relationship between different variables

### 3. Predictive Questions: "What is likely to happen?"
#### Techniques : 
##### - Regression Analysis : Predicting outcomes based on relationships between variable
##### - Time Series Forecasting : Predicting future values based on past trends
##### - Machine Learning Models : Using argorithms to predict future outcomes based on historical data

### 4. Prescriptive Questions: "What should we do?"
#### Techniques : 
##### - Optimization models: Finding the best solution from a set of alternatives
##### - Simulation: Modeling scenarios to predict outcomes
##### - Decision analysis: Evaluating and comparing different decisions

### 5. Classification Questions: "Which category does this belong to?"
#### Techniques : 
##### - Logistic regression: Predicting the probability of a categorical outcome
##### - Decision trees: Splitting data into branches to classify it
##### - Support vector machines: Finding the best boundary to separate categories
##### - Neural networks: Using interconnected nodes to classify data
